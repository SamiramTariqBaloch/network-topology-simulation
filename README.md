# network-topology-simulation
This project simulates common computer network topologies including Star, Bus, Ring, and Mesh using Python. The simulation visualizes each topology and demonstrates the impact of node failure on network connectivity. The project is implemented using NetworkX for graph modeling and Matplotlib for visualization,
